1. Flatten Lists
Write a program to flatten several lists of numbers received in the following format:
▪ String with numbers or empty strings separated by "|"
▪ Values are separated by spaces (" ", one or several)
▪ Order the output list from the last to the first matrix sub-lists and their values from left to right as shown below
Examples
Input Output
1 2 3 |4 5 6 | 7 88 7 88 4 5 6 1 2 3
7 | 4 5|1 0| 2 5 |3 3 2 5 1 0 4 5 7
1| 4 5 6 7 | 8 9 8 9 4 5 6 7 1


2. Matrix Modification

Write a program that reads a matrix from the console and changes its values. On the first line, you will get the matrix's rows - N. You will get elements for each column on the following N lines, separated with a single space. You will be receiving commands in the following format:
• "Add {row} {col} {value}" – Increase the number at the given coordinates with the value.
• "Subtract {row} {col} {value}" – Decrease the number at the given coordinates by the value.
If the coordinate is invalid, you should print "Invalid coordinates". A coordinate is valid if both of the given indexes are in range [0; len() – 1].
When you receive "END", you should print the matrix and stop the program.

3. Knight Game

Chess is the oldest game, but it is still popular these days. It will be used only one chess piece for this task - the Knight.
A chess knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated. It can move to the nearest square but not on the same row, column, or diagonal. (e.g., it can move two squares horizontally, then one square vertically, or it can move one square horizontally then two squares vertically - i.e., in an "L" pattern.)
The knight game is played on a board with dimensions N x N.
You will receive a board with "K" for knights and "0" for empty cells. Your task is to remove knights until no knights that can attack one another with one move are left.
Always remove the knight who can attack the greatest number of knights. If there are two or more knights with the same number of attacks, remove the top-left one.
Input
• On the first line, you will receive integer N - the size of the board
• On the following N lines, you will receive strings with "K" and "0"
Output
• Print a single integer with the number of knights that need to be removed.
Constraints
• The size of the board will be 0 < N < 30
• Time limit: 0.3 sec. Memory limit: 16 MB

4. Easter Bunny

Your task is to collect as many eggs as possible.
On the first line, you will be given a number representing the size of the field. On the following few lines, you will be given a field with:
• One bunny - randomly placed in it and marked with the symbol "B"
• Number of eggs placed at different positions of the field and traps marked with "X"
Your job is to determine the direction in which the bunny should go to collect the maximum number of eggs. The directions that should be considered as possible are up, down, left, and right. If you reach a trap while checking some of the directions, you should not consider the fields after the trap in this direction. For more clarifications, see the examples below.
Note: Consider ONLY the paths from which the bunny has collected 1 or more eggs.
Input
• A number representing the size of the field
• The matrix representing the field (each position separated by a single space)
Output
• The direction which should be considered as best (lowercase)
• The field positions from which we are collecting eggs as lists
• The total number of eggs collected
Constraints
• There will NOT be two or more paths consisting of the same total amount of eggs.

The number of eggs if the bunny goes up is equal to 7. If he goes down = 9, there are no eggs on the left and 87 on the right. That's why the bunny should follow this direction (right) and collect the eggs provided there.

5. Alice in Wonderland

Alice is going to the mad tea party, to see her friends. On the way to the party, she needs to collect bags of tea.
You will be given an integer n for the size of the Wonderland territory with a square shape. On the following n lines, you will receive the rows of the territory:
• Alice will be placed in a random position, marked with the letter "A".
• On the territory, there will be bags of tea, represented as numbers. If Alice steps on a number position, she collects the tea bags and increases the quantity with the corresponding number.
• There will always be one rabbit hole on the territory marked with the letter "R".
• All of the empty positions will be marked with ".".
After the field state, you will be given commands for Alice's movements. Move commands can be: "up", "down", "left" or "right".
When Alice collects at least 10 bags of tea, she is ready to go to the tea party, and she does not need to continue collecting. Otherwise, if she steps on the rabbit hole or goes out of the territory, she can't return, and the program ends.
In the end, the path she walked had to be marked with '*'.
For more clarifications, see the examples below.
Input
• On the first line, you will be given the integer n – the size of the square matrix
• On the following n lines - matrix representing the field (each position separated by a single space)
• On each of the following lines, you will be given a move command
Output
• On the first line:
o If Alice steps on the rabbit hole or she go out of the territory, print:
"Alice didn't make it to the tea party."
o If she collected at least 10 bags of tea, print:
"She did it! She went to the party."
• On the following lines, print the matrix.
Constraints
• Alice will always either go outside the Wonderland or collect 10 bags of tea
• All the commands will be valid
• All of the given numbers will be valid integers in the range [0, 10]

6. Range Day

You are participating in a Firearm course. It is a training day at the shooting range.
You will be given a matrix with 5 rows and 5 columns. It is a shotgun range represented as some symbols separated by a single space:
• Your position is marked with the symbol "A"
• Targets marked with symbol "x"
• All of the empty positions will be marked with "."
After the field state, you will be given an integer representing the number of commands you will receive. The possible commands are:
• "move {right/left/up/down} {steps}" – you should move in the given direction with the given steps.
You can only move if the field you want to step on is marked with ".".
• "shoot {right/left/up/down}" – you should shoot in the given direction (from your current position without moving). Beware that there might be targets that stand in the way of other targets, and you cannot reach them - you can shoot only the nearest target. When you have shot a target, the field becomes empty position (".").
Validate the positions since they can be outside the field.
Keep track of all the shot targets:

• If at any point there are no targets left, end the program and print: "Training completed! All {count_targets} targets hit.".
• If, after you perform all the commands, there are some targets left print: "Training not completed!
{count_left_targets} targets left.".
Finally, print the index positions of the targets that you hit, as shown in the examples.
Input
• 5 lines representing the field (symbols, separated by a single space)
• N - count of commands
• On the following N lines - the commands in the format described above
Output
• On the first line, print one of the following:
o If all the targets were shot
"Training completed! All {count_targets} targets hit."
o Otherwise:
"Training not completed! {count_left_targets} targets left."
• Finally, print the index positions "[{row}, {column}]" of the targets that you hit, as shown in the
examples.
Constrains
• All the commands will be valid
• There will always be at least one target

7. Present Delivery

The presents are ready, and Santa has to deliver them to the kids.
You will receive an integer m for the number of presents Santa has and an integer n for the size of the neighborhood with a square shape. On the following lines, you will receive the matrix, which represents the neighborhood.
Santa will be in a random cell, marked with the letter "S". Each cell stands for a house where children may live. If the cell has "X" on it, that means there lives a naughty kid. Otherwise, if a nice kid lives there, the cell is marked by "V". There can also be cells marked with "C" for cookies. All of the empty positions will be marked with "-".
Santa can move "up", "down", "left", "right" with one position each time. These will be the commands that you receive. If he moves to a house with a nice kid, the kid receives a present, but if Santa reaches a house with a naughty kid, he doesn't drop a present. If the command sends Santa to a cell marked with "C", Santa eats cookies and becomes happy and extra generous to all the kids around him* (meaning all of them will receive presents - it doesn't matter if naughty or nice). If Santa has been to a house, the cell becomes "-".
Note: *around him means on his left, right, upwards, and downwards by one cell. In this case, Santa doesn't move to these cells, or if he does, he returns to the cell where the cookie was.
If Santa runs out of presents or receives the command "Christmas morning", you should end the program.
Keep in mind that you should check whether all the nice kids received presents.
Input
• On the first line, you are given the integer m - the count of presents
• On the second - integer n - the size of the neighborhood
• The following n lines hold the values for every row
• On each of the following lines you will get a command
Output
• On the first line:
o If Santa runs out of presents, but there are still some nice kids left print: "Santa ran out of
presents!"
• Next, print the matrix.
• In the end, print one of these messages:
o If he manages to give all the nice kids presents, print:
"Good job, Santa! {count_nice_kids} happy nice kid/s."
o Otherwise, print:
"No presents for {count nice kids} nice kid/s."
Constraints
• The size of the square matrix will be between [2…10].
• Santa's position will be marked with 'S'.
• There will always be at least 1 nice kid.
• There won't be a case where the cookie is on the border of the matrix.

Good job, Santa! 2 happy nice kid/s.
Santa has 5 presents. The size of the matrix is 4. After we receive the matrix, we start reading commands. The first one is "up". The "X" means there is a naughty kid, so Santa moves on without dropping any presents. Next, he reaches a nice kid and drops a present. The "down" command moves Santa to an empty cell.
The last command before the "Christmas morning" message is "right". Again we have a nice kid. The count of nice kids reached 2, and we don't have any nice kids without presents left. So we print the appropriate message.

No presents for 1 nice kid/s.
The commands send Santa to a cell with a cookie, so all of the kids around him receive presents. He runs out of presents because we have 3 kids there and only 3 presents. The program ends, and we have 1 nice kid that hasn't received a present.
