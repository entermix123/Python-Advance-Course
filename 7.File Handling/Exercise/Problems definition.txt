1. Even Lines

Write a program that reads a text file and prints on the console its even lines. Line numbers start from 0. Before you print the result, replace {"-", ",", ".", "!", "?"} with "@" and reverse the order of the words.
Examples text.txt output
-I was quick to judge him, but it wasn't his fault.
-Is this some kind of joke?! Is it?
-Quick, hide here. It is safer.
fault@ his wasn't it but him@ judge to quick was @I
safer@ is It here@ hide @Quick@


2. Line Numbers

Write a program that reads a text file, inserts line numbers in front of each line, and counts all the letters and punctuation marks. The result should be written to another text file.
Examples text.txt output.txt
-I was quick to judge him, but it wasn't his fault.
-Is this some kind of joke?! Is it?
-Quick, hide here. It is safer.
Line 1: -I was quick to judge him, but it wasn't his fault. (37)(4)
Line 2: -Is this some kind of joke?! Is it? (24)(4)
Line 3: -Quick, hide here. It is safer. (22)(4)


3. File Manipulator

Create a program that will receive commands until the command "End". The commands can be:
 "Create-{file_name}" - Creates the given file with an empty content. If the file already exists, remove the existing text in it (as if the file is created again)
 "Add-{file_name}-{content}" - Append the content and a new line after it. If the file does not exist, create it, and add the content
 "Replace-{file_name}-{old_string}-{new_string}" - Open the file and replace all the occurrences of the old string with the new string. If the file does not exist, print: "An error occurred"
 "Delete-{file_name}" - Delete the file. If the file does not exist, print: "An error occurred"
Example Input Comment
Create-file.txt
The first command creates the empty file
Add-file.txt-First Line
Add-file.txt-Second Line
Replace-random.txt-Some-some
Replace-file.txt-First-1st
Replace-file.txt-Second-2nd
Delete-random.txt
Delete-file.txt
End
After the first and second Add command, the content is:
First Line
Second Line
On the first Replace command, an error must occur
After the next two Replace commands, the content is:
1st Line
2nd Line
After the first Delete command, an error occurs
Finally, the 'file.txt' file is deleted


4. Directory Traversal

Write a program that traverses a given directory for all files. Search through the first level of the directory only and write information about each found file in report.txt. The files should be grouped by their extension. Extensions should be ordered by name alphabetically. The files with extensions should also be sorted by name. report.txt should be saved in the chosen directory.
Examples Input Directory View report.txt
input
.

dir view:

Example
	idenx.html
	index.js
	python.py
demo.pptx
log.txt
notes.txt
program.py


output:

.html
- - - index.html
.js
- - - index.js
.pptx
- - - demo.pptx
.py
- - - program.py
- - - python.py
.txt
- - - log.txt
- - - notes.txt
